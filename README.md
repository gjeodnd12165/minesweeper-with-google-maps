# Mine Sweeper with Map
This project is to make minesweeper with map.  
~~Basically, roads in the map will seperate a area of the minesweeper.~~  
Now I will use voronoi diagram to define areas.
## Todo
- [ ] Find some good voronoi diagram module
- [ ] Create a json conversion function appropriate for the module's point interface.
- [ ] [see](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vx/voronoi), [this too](https://www.react-graph-gallery.com/voronoi), it's a pretty good module for this project.
    - [ ] try to make some react version of this project. - make some branch
