This project is to make minesweeper with map.

You probably don't have a permission for this document.  
It's only for me to view how the response looks as of now.
## Todo
- [ ] make actual minesweeper game with the data
    - basic game logic completed
        - click to locate -> the address is sent to box
    - visual improvements
        - traditional minesweeper theme
    - programmaic improvements
        - performance improvements
        - pattern or sturucture improvements
            - reduce use*Something* functions -> consider useContext

### Idea and small improvements
- Stop game when cleared
- Cell coloring
