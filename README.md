    - logic is almost completed
    - visual improvements
    - performace improvements
    - programmatic improvements
- [ ] use the data from overpass api
- [ ] give a user some selectablity of region

## BUGS
- [ ] At the start, CLEAR! message is showing
- [ ] If I change the location with form, `Cell`s don't change.  
It retains its shape and position, but the number of the cells is changed.
